This repository demonstrates how we can easily build a webpage consisting of maps, earthquake data, and tectonic plates. This was all accomplished by using tools that are free for anyone to access across the world wide web.

The resources used in **Mappping Earthquakes**:

- Javascript

- Mapbox API

- Leaflet js library

- HTML & CSS

Using these tools enabled the creation of various maps using common practices and technology. The Earthquake_Challenge Folder contain 3 styles of basemap tiles that can be selected by the user. On top of the base tile is data where the earthquakes have been for the last 7 days and known tectonic plate data. Both of which can also be toggled by the user against any of the 3 base maps.
